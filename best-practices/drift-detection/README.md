# Best Practices - Drift Detection

This section shows best practices for accessing drift between two datasets. The notebook shows how to use machine learning techniques to identify drift as well as statistical techniques like PSI.

**Goal:** show an example of determining drift between two datasets.

## The Data
The dataset used in this tutorial is a public dataset of avocado sales. It can be found here <https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices>.

## Workflow
1. Import Data
2. Build Model to Detect Drift
3. Interpreting Drift
